# data-mining-with-RapidMiner


## Purpose of this project

A Data Mining methodology is applied in the dataset “Facebook metrics” taken from the UCI machine learning repository.


## Methodology and data

We'll apply the CRISP-DM methodology composed of 6 phases in order to develop, through supervised regression learning, a prediction model of the target variable - Total Interactions - which is composed of the sum of likes, comments and shares of 500 posts published by a well-known cosmetics brand on Facebook. 

The target variable is numeric, and therefore the analysis will be concerning the application of a regression supervised learning model.

Several target variable prediction algorithms were applied in RapidMiner program, and it was concluded that the model that achieves the best performance is the Linear Regression.

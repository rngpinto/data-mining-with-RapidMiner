# data-mining-with-RapidMiner
Data Mining Project of my Postgraduate course in Data Analysis for Business


In this project, a Data Mining methodology is applied in a data set called “Facebook metrics Data Set”, which was taken from the UCI machine learning repository.



In order to carry out this analysis, we'll apply the CRISP-DM methodology composed of 6 phases in order to develop, through supervised regression learning, a prediction model of the target variable - Total Interactions - which is composed of the sum of likes, comments and shares of 500 posts published by a well-known cosmetics brand on Facebook. 
The target variable is numeric, and therefore the analysis will be concerning the application of a regression supervised learning.
Several target variable prediction algorithms were applied in RapidMiner program, and it was concluded that the model that achieves the best performance is the Linear Regression.
